<h1>Background</h1>
Upon registering, users on the app you must complete a 10-step onboarding process. Roughly 84% of users complete onboarding. Upon completing onboarding, users are prompted with a screen that uses the information from onboarding to populate the following sentence: “There are X venues near Y location that can accommodate Z guests,” with a CTA to perform a search and see these venues. Some research suggested that users who do not add a location during onboarding are less likely to perform searches and send enquiries to venues. 
We wanted to increase the proportion of our registered users who search for venues and, ultimately, send them enquiries; therefore, we created an A/B test with three variants to test two prevailing different hypotheses. 
Variant 1 hid the option of choosing “Undecided” on the location step of onboarding (leaving only data-entry or SKIP as options). 
Variant 2 hid the text around the counts of venues in your location, leaving only “We found some perfect venues for you!”. 
Variant 0 was the control. 
Only new users who saw the location step were included in the test.
The data from this test are attached below.

<h1>The task</h1>
<h2>Explore the results and write up findings from these data, documenting your conclusions as if you were sharing them with the product team. Some questions you might want to consider including are:</h>
•	What was the outcome of this test?
•	Are there any business recommendations you might suggest of the back of this?
•	Are there any other findings/suggestions that come from the data?
•	What additional questions you might want to investigate given more time/data? What metrics would you use to use to answer that question, and what data you might need in order to look at this?
•	Any other comments or improvements that come to mind.
Please submit the write-up of your findings and any scripts/files that show the calculations you have performed.
